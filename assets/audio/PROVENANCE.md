# Audio replacement provenance

The active soundtrack and effect files in this directory are the supplied production set.
`LICENSE.md` and this `PROVENANCE.md` travel with the public audio payload.
`v73-audio-build-audit.json` remains in the source repository as an internal integrity record and is intentionally excluded from the runtime package.

The current user-supplied soundtrack has one dedicated loop for every chapter:
Chlum, Ločenice, Nesměň, Besednice and Malše/KD Slávie. The menu intentionally
reuses the Chlum loop.

The four shared effects below were supplied from the earlier `pr297` asset bundle. The same bytes were present in the other supplied work directories; the SHA-256 values confirm that one canonical copy is sufficient:

| File | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `effects/danger-pulse.mp3` | `5f8e3fd38e3196c7dca7c5909ac8344dc8b8cae214ca22b0de194b6eaeb096fe` |
| `effects/dig-hit.mp3` | `32cd46cd2d1e509fb1e162e9eb005f2bbf9b6bf6542fdbd64dcab2ac08197ea3` |
| `effects/finding-chime.mp3` | `ec0c5df491128adc4b53758892aa541cded50df60942ac1db347670b811fb525` |
| `effects/journey-loop.mp3` | `58e6b38769998ecfc281f8a7d8fce4b55b648a7e2fabf7e09cfdc6f2a36e03d4` |

`ambient-nesmen2.mp3` and `ambient-slavia2.mp3` were explicitly marked as unregistered alternates in the supplied license, so they are not part of the active or offline-cached build.
